This project was just for a test, and I completed it in a very short time because I didn't have much time. I'm an expert in GetX state management and familiar with BloC state management.

I have excellent experience with map positioning and have worked with both Google Maps and OSM Maps. I chose to use OSM Map in this project and didn't want to include my Google API token.

I have worked on engineering survey, mapping, and positioning apps for three years. I developed a powerful app named Vernal, which you can check on my CV.
